            <p> Chess is a game of strategy and tactics. Each player commands an army of 16 chessmen, pawns and other pieces 
            (the king, queen, bishops, knights, and rooks).</p>
            
        <p>A well-played chess game has three stages. In the opening, the players bring out their forces in preparation for combat. 
        The middlegame begins as the players maneuver for position and carry out attacks and counterattacks.
        The final stage is the endgame when, with fewer pawns and pieces left on the board, it is safer for the kings to come out and join the final battle.</p>
