                <div class="content">
          <p>
                  Chess is a game that are governed by a set of rules. It is not uncommon for a chess player to enter a tournament
                  for the first time and find out that many of the simple things he is doing are not allowed. 
                  This could be as simple as touching a piece and then moving another piece (you can’t do that).
                  Whatever the case it is important to know the rules of chess if you are going to ever play in person. 
                  You never know if the person sitting in front of you is a real “rules” person and will point out every mistake you make.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since rules are pretty much black and white, and I find it pointless to copy and paste from other sites that
                  have the rules spelled out very well, I’m providing a list of three sites that cover everything you need to know as far as rules, both official and “unwritten.”

                <h2>Check</h2>
                <div class="content" >
          <p>
              When the king of a player can be taken by a piece of the opponent, one says that the king is in check. 
              For instance, the white player moves his rook to a position such that it attacks the black king,
              if black doesn't do anything about it, the rook could take the black king
              in the next move: we say that the white rook gives check. 
              It is considered good manners to say check when one checks ones opponent.
              It is not allowed to make a move, such that ones king is in check after the move.

                <h2>Mate</h2>
                <div class="content" >
          <p>
              When a player is in check, and he cannot make a move such that after the move,
              the king is not in check, then he is mated. The player that is mated lost the game, and the player that mated him won the game.
              <br><strong>Note that </strong>there are three different possible ways to remove a check:
           <br>
            <br> 1. Move the king away to a square where he is not in check.
            <br> 2. Take the piece that gives the check.
            <br> 3. (In case of a check, given by a rook, bishop or queen: ) move a piece between the checking piece and the king.

                <h2>Stalemate</h2>
                <div class="content" >
          <p>
              When a player cannot make any legal move, but he is not in check, then the player is said to be stalemated.
              In a case of a stalemate, the game is a draw.
